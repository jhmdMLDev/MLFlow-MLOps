# slo_lr_detection
Detecting left and right eyes in SLO images.

## Example
Here is an example of using the main functions of this package:

### Part 1
Import the required libraries:
```
import cv2
from slo_lr_detection.slo_lr_detection import slo_ml_is_left
```

### Part 2
Specify the required paths and run the model:
```
img = cv2.imread("\path\to\image", 0)
model_path = "\path\to\model"
is_left = slo_ml_is_left(img, model_path, device="cpu")
```

# GCP Guide

This guide provides instructions for mounting Google Cloud Storage, setting up NVIDIA GPU support, and building and pushing a Docker image to Google Artifact Registry. 

## Mount Google Cloud Storage to Local Directory

To mount the Google Cloud Storage bucket named `pm-test4` to a local directory named `gcs`, use `gcsfuse` with flags for implicit directories, directory renaming limit, and maximum connections per host.

```
gcsfuse --implicit-dirs --rename-dir-limit=100 --max-conns-per-host=100 "pm-test4" ./gcs
```

## Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit on local Linux (No need for vertex AI pipelines, already there!)

To enable GPU support for Docker on a local Linux device, first update your package list. Then, install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, reload the system daemon, and restart Docker to apply the changes.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Run Docker Container with GPU Support (No need for vertex AI pipelines, already there!)

With NVIDIA GPU support enabled, run the Docker container using the `--gpus all` flag, and mount the local `gcs` directory to `/gcs` within the container. The Docker image should be named `lr_image:latest`.

```
sudo docker run --gpus all -v /gcs:/gcs/ lr_image:latest
```

## Get the Active Project ID in Google Cloud 

Use Google Cloud SDKâ€™s configuration command to retrieve the active project ID. This will confirm which Google Cloud project you are working in.

```
gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)'
```

## Define Image URI for Docker (Important)

Set an environment variable named `IMAGE_URI` for your Docker image in Google Artifact Registry. Substitute `$LEFT_RIGHT_PROJECT_ID` with your project ID and `$REPO_NAME` with the repository name. The resulting format should be similar to:

`northamerica-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev/analytical-rain-397718/left-right-detection/lr_image:latest`

## Build the Docker Image

With the image URI set, build the Docker image using a Dockerfile located in the `docker` directory, tagging it with the `IMAGE_URI` specified in the previous step.

```
docker build -t "$IMAGE_URI" -f ./docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Authenticate Docker with Google Cloud Artifact Registry

Use `gcloud` to configure Docker authentication for `northamerica-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev`, allowing you to push the image to Artifact Registry.

```
gclout  auth configure-docker northamerica-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev
```

## Push Docker Image to Google Artifact Registry

Finally, push the Docker image to the registry using the `IMAGE_URI` variable set earlier.

```
docker push "$IMAGE_URI"
```

## Monitor Model Progress in MLFlow

Monitor the models and metrics.

```
poetry run mlflow ui --backend-store-uri /gcs/left-right-detection/checks/mlruns --port 5001
```

This concludes the setup and deployment process for this project. Ensure each step is followed in order for a successful deployment.
